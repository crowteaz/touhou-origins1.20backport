## Touhou Origins <img alt="Icon" height="16" src="/src/main/resources/assets/touhouorigins/icon.png" width="16"/>
A Minecraft mod for the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/) that adds more origins to the [Origins](https://github.com/apace100/origins-fabric) mod inspired by the [Touhou Project](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Wiki) series.

Requires:

- [Fabric API](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric)
- [Pehkui](https://github.com/Virtuoel/Pehkui)
- [Origins](https://github.com/apace100/origins-fabric)

Only change made from the original mod was changing the required Minecraft version to 1.20 from 1.20.1. Might be unstable due to needing more testing.
Also don't forget to support the original release of the mod too!
