## Touhou Origins <img alt="Icon" height="16" src="/src/main/resources/assets/touhouorigins/icon.png" width="16"/>
A Minecraft mod for the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/) that adds more origins to the [Origins](https://github.com/apace100/origins-fabric) mod inspired by the [Touhou Project](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Wiki) series.

Requires:

- [Fabric API](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric)
- [Pehkui](https://github.com/Virtuoel/Pehkui)
- [Origins](https://github.com/apace100/origins-fabric)

Only change made from the original mod was changing the required Minecraft version to 1.20 from 1.20.1. Might be unstable due to needing more testing.
